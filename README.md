# ThreeJS Combat

A basic threejs app with two characters fighting. Created to get started with threejs and experiment with it.

The initial commit only had two characters who punch on click. The "Add Game Logic" commit will bring in the basic game features that enables the user to engage in an hand-to-hand combat with a monster. A fairly simple game.

As of this commit, the Dodge feature does NOT work on Chrome Android as dblclick event is not monitorable there. Please use a PC or other mobile browsers to play the game. This should be fixed in future commits.
